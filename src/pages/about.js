      <p>
        Computer, belay that order. We finished our first sensor sweep of the
        neutral zone. For an android with no feelings, he sure managed to evoke
        them in others. We could cause a diplomatic crisis. Take the ship into
        the Neutral Zone Yes, absolutely, I do indeed concur, wholeheartedly!
        Could someone survive inside a transporter buffer for 75 years? When has
        justice ever been as simple as a rule book? Did you come here for
        something in particular or just general Riker-bashing? Sorry, Data. We
        know you're dealing in stolen ore. But I wanna talk about the
        assassination attempt on Lieutenant Worf.
