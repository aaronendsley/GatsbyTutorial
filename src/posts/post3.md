## Starfleet Borg Interaction protocol

We know you're dealing in stolen ore. But I wanna talk about the assassination attempt on Lieutenant Worf. That might've been one of the shortest assignments in the history of Starfleet. What's a knock-out like you doing in a computer-generated gin joint like this? Earl Grey tea, watercress sandwiches... and Bularian canapés? Are you up for promotion? Flair is what marks the difference between artistry and mere competence. The look in your eyes, I recognize it. You used to have it for me. A surprise party? Mr. Worf, I hate surprise parties. I would _never_ do that to you. I will obey your orders. I will serve this ship as First Officer. And in an attack against the Enterprise, I will die with this crew. But I will not break my oath of loyalty to Starfleet.
